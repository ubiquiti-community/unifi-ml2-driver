    This is release ``1.0.0`` of the ``networking-generic-switch`` project. The
    project includes an ML2 mechanism driver for the Networking service that
    provides integration with the Bare Metal service.

    The main use case for this project is multi-tenant network isolation for
    bare metal servers using VLANs.  The driver manages the VLAN membership of
    network switch edge ports to which bare metal servers are attached.

    Various network switches from different vendors are supported, including
    Arista, Brocade, Cisco, Dell, Huawei, and others.
