    Netmiko has not changed the device name for hp_comware to hpe_comware
    yet. See

    https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/blob/develop/netmiko/ssh_dispatcher.py

    Therefore, the device will fail to load as netmiko will only recognize
    "hp_comware". We'll need to alias "hpe_comware" with "hp_comware" till
    netmiko recognizes HPE.
