    To improve logging, the device name is now passed to the device driver
    class.  If you implemented an out-of-tree device driver inheriting from
    ``GenericSwitchDevice`` or ``NetmikoSwitch``, your code needs to be adapted
    to accept this new argument to the ``__init__`` method.  It is recommended
    to use the ``*args, **kwargs`` pattern to accept and pass all unhandled
    arguments to the base class.

    Ignore unknown options starting with ``ngs_`` instead of crashing.
