fixes:
  - Fixes an issue where a switch interface will revert to VLAN 1, trunk mode,
    or other various configurations when a port is unbound.  See
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-generic-switch/+bug/1752480.
features:
  - Adds a new configuration option ``[genericswitch:<switch name>]
    ngs_port_default_vlan``, which is optional. If ``ngs_port_default_vlan`` is
    set to a VLAN ID, the switch's interfaces will be restored to that VLAN
    when ports are unbound.
