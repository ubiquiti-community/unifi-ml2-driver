fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the configuration for ngs to use `::1` instead of `localhost`, since
    the `/etc/hosts` is using `localhost` as alias for IPv4 and IPv6.
  - |
    Fixed timeout in netmiko by setting `cmd_verify` to False, we don't need to
    verify command echo for each command in in `config_set`
