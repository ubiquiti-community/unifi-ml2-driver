    Adds a new driver, ``netmiko_juniper``, for Juniper Junos OS devices.

    The private configuration mode is used in order to provide a level of
    isolation between sessions, and to ensure that uncommitted changes are not
    left on the switch following a failure to commit the configuration.

    Configuration errors are handled by ensuring that the commit operation is
    successful.

    A retry mechanism is used to handle temporary failures due to multiple
    sessions attempting to lock the Junos OS configuration database
    concurrently.  The retry mechanism is configured via the configuration
    options ``ngs_commit_interval`` and ``ngs_commit_timeout``.
